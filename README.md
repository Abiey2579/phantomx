- **Community values and consumer behavior**
- **Average income and regional salary benchmarks**
- **Cost of living metrics** — transportation, rent, food, healthcare, education
- **Familiarity with business infrastructure**

These factors are processed alongside traditional indicators like **GDP trends**, **supply and demand forecasts**, **market sentiment**, and **data credibility validation** — providing a multi-dimensional view of every market or investment opportunity.
